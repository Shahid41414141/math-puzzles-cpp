Three ants are positioned on separate corners of a triangle.
If each ant moves along an edge toward a randomly chosen corner,
what is the chance that none of the ants collide?
How would the problem generalize if there were n ants positioned on
the vertices of a regular n-gon, again each moving along an edge to
a random adjacent vertex?
