Puzzle 4: Slicing Up A Pie
Alice and Bob are preparing for a holiday party, and each has a pie
to slice up into pieces.
They decide to have a little contest to make things fun. Each person
is allowed to make 3 cuts of the pie with a knife, and whoever ends
up with more pieces is the winner. They agree stacking is not
allowed, but that “center” pieces without the edge crust are
permissible.
How many pieces can be made using 3 cuts? What about 4 cuts, or
more generally n cuts?
